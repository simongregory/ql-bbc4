      <p begin="00:00:14.84" id="p1" end="00:00:17.32">it's impossible not to be impressed</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.32" id="p2" end="00:00:20.68">by the sheer grandeur and splendour</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.68" id="p3" end="00:00:23.08">and power of the natural world.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.52" id="p4" end="00:00:30.00">Ten years ago, in a television<br />series called Planet Earth,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.00" id="p5" end="00:00:35.44">we revealed many of those wonders,<br />but today, much has changed.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.68" id="p6" end="00:00:41.84">We can now show life on our planet<br />in entirely new ways.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:44.24" id="p7" end="00:00:47.84">Bring you closer to animals<br />than ever before.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.88" id="p8" end="00:00:55.64">And reveal new wildlife dramas<br />for the very first time.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.24" id="p9" end="00:01:00.72">But that's not all.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.84" id="p10" end="00:01:04.68">Our planet has changed too.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.68" id="p11" end="00:01:08.92">Never have those wildernesses been<br />as fragile and as precious</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.92" id="p12" end="00:01:10.44">as they are today.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.60" id="p13" end="00:01:16.60">At this crucial time<br />for the natural world,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.60" id="p14" end="00:01:19.92">we will journey to<br />every corner of the globe...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:21.52" id="p15" end="00:01:24.48">..to explore the greatest treasures<br />of our living planet...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:31.36" id="p16" end="00:01:35.32">..and reveal the extreme lengths<br />animals go to</p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.32" id="p17" end="00:01:36.68">to survive.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.28" id="p18" end="00:01:55.44">Finally, we will explore our cities</p>
      <p begin="00:01:55.44" id="p19" end="00:01:57.96">to see how life is adapting</p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.96" id="p20" end="00:02:00.12">to the newest habitat on Earth.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.48" id="p21" end="00:02:05.20">This is Planet Earth II.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:45.28" id="p22" end="00:02:49.40">There are hundreds<br />of thousands of islands,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:49.40" id="p23" end="00:02:53.04">each one a world in miniature,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.04" id="p24" end="00:02:56.04">a microcosm of our living planet.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.84" id="p25" end="00:03:01.08">The struggles to survive<br />on these remote lands</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.08" id="p26" end="00:03:05.24">reflect the challenges faced<br />by all life on Earth.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:15.84" id="p27" end="00:03:20.40">The tiny island of Escudo<br />off the coast of Panama.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:22.16" id="p28" end="00:03:26.36">Home to the pygmy three-toed sloth.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29.60" id="p29" end="00:03:32.92">This is a male<br />and life here suits him well.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.44" id="p30" end="00:03:39.88">Mangroves provide<br />all the leaves he can eat</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.88" id="p31" end="00:03:43.24">and there are no predators<br />to worry him.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:45.20" id="p32" end="00:03:50.20">Island life may seem idyllic<br />but it comes at a price.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.84" id="p33" end="00:03:55.44">There are only a few hundred<br />pygmy sloths in existence.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:56.88" id="p34" end="00:03:59.00">And he needs a mate.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:00.56" id="p35" end="00:04:03.68">SCREECHING</p>
      <p begin="00:04:03.68" id="p36" end="00:04:05.68">That's an enticing call...</p>
      <p begin="00:04:07.76" id="p37" end="00:04:08.80">..from a female.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:11.64" id="p38" end="00:04:13.96">Somewhere out there.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:16.84" id="p39" end="00:04:21.00">And this, for a sloth,<br />is a quick reaction.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:41.56" id="p40" end="00:04:43.84">FEMALE SCREECHES AGAIN</p>
      <p begin="00:04:43.84" id="p41" end="00:04:47.56">The problem is,<br />there's deep water between them.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.28" id="p42" end="00:04:52.52">So what should<br />any red-blooded sloth do?</p>
      <p begin="00:04:57.84" id="p43" end="00:04:59.56">Swim, of course.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:29.96" id="p44" end="00:05:31.48">Could this be her?</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.60" id="p45" end="00:05:42.04">He does his best<br />to put on a turn of speed.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:52.68" id="p46" end="00:05:54.80">But she's not the one.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:54.80" id="p47" end="00:05:59.92">She already has a baby and she won't<br />mate again until it leaves her</p>
      <p begin="00:05:59.92" id="p48" end="00:06:01.60">in about six months' time.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:08.72" id="p49" end="00:06:13.12">Even life on a paradise island<br />can have its limitations.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:16.64" id="p50" end="00:06:17.68">MORE SCREECHING</p>
      <p begin="00:06:18.92" id="p51" end="00:06:21.28">But at least she can't be far away.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:26.80" id="p52" end="00:06:32.04">The world's entire population<br />of pygmy sloths is isolated</p>
      <p begin="00:06:32.04" id="p53" end="00:06:35.60">on a speck of land no bigger<br />than New York's Central Park.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:38.80" id="p54" end="00:06:43.36">The size of an island<br />has a huge influence on the fate</p>
      <p begin="00:06:43.36" id="p55" end="00:06:45.16">of those cast away there.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:49.88" id="p56" end="00:06:53.68">The island of Komodo in Indonesia.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:04.16" id="p57" end="00:07:06.24">Home to dragons.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:23.56" id="p58" end="00:07:28.72">Ten feet long and weighing<br />an impressive 150 lbs,</p>
      <p begin="00:07:28.72" id="p59" end="00:07:33.16">these are the largest living lizards<br />on the planet.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:44.72" id="p60" end="00:07:47.96">It's unusual to find<br />large predators on islands.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:51.68" id="p61" end="00:07:56.60">Yet, for four million years, the<br />Komodo dragon has dominated here.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:06.56" id="p62" end="00:08:09.72">It might seem there<br />wouldn't be enough food</p>
      <p begin="00:08:09.72" id="p63" end="00:08:12.96">to support such giants on<br />this relatively small island.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:14.52" id="p64" end="00:08:17.12">But reptiles, being cold-blooded,</p>
      <p begin="00:08:17.12" id="p65" end="00:08:21.16">need only about a tenth of the food<br />a carnivorous mammal would.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:25.76" id="p66" end="00:08:28.88">A single meal<br />will last a dragon a month.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:32.40" id="p67" end="00:08:36.72">There are so successful that their<br />only serious competition comes from</p>
      <p begin="00:08:36.72" id="p68" end="00:08:38.48">others of their own kind.</p>
      <p begin="00:08:39.64" id="p69" end="00:08:42.80">And there are some 2,000<br />of them here.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:05.80" id="p70" end="00:09:11.04">This giant, however, isn't looking<br />for food - he's looking for a mate.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:15.04" id="p71" end="00:09:18.76">Female dragons come into season<br />only once a year.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:29.16" id="p72" end="00:09:30.48">She's receptive.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:38.56" id="p73" end="00:09:40.80">So far, so good.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:45.24" id="p74" end="00:09:47.96">But he's strayed<br />into someone else's patch.</p>
      <p begin="00:09:53.68" id="p75" end="00:09:58.36">Another huge male<br />thinks he is the king here.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:03.00" id="p76" end="00:10:05.72">Space being limited on islands,</p>
      <p begin="00:10:05.72" id="p77" end="00:10:10.72">dragon territories overlap<br />and that creates continual conflict.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:18.20" id="p78" end="00:10:21.48">In dragon society,<br />size is everything.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:36.68" id="p79" end="00:10:41.32">But if rivals are closely matched,<br />the outcome can be uncertain.</p>
      <p begin="00:10:48.72" id="p80" end="00:10:52.56">Muscular tails strike<br />with the power of sledgehammers.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:02.36" id="p81" end="00:11:06.60">And their serrated teeth<br />are as sharp as steak knives.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:18.00" id="p82" end="00:11:20.72">Each tries to topple his opponent.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:41.76" id="p83" end="00:11:43.04">Defeated.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:44.24" id="p84" end="00:11:47.08">Only the most powerful dragons</p>
      <p begin="00:11:47.08" id="p85" end="00:11:48.72">win the right to mate.</p>
      <p begin="00:11:57.12" id="p86" end="00:12:01.04">The limited food and space<br />on small islands</p>
      <p begin="00:12:01.04" id="p87" end="00:12:03.56">can often lead<br />to intense competition.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:04.76" id="p88" end="00:12:07.52">But some islands are immense.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:08.60" id="p89" end="00:12:10.56">More like miniature continents.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:11.88" id="p90" end="00:12:17.08">And these provide opportunities<br />for life to experiment and evolve.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:21.84" id="p91" end="00:12:27.32">Madagascar is one of the biggest<br />islands and also one of the oldest,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:27.32" id="p92" end="00:12:32.16">having split away from Africa<br />over 120 million years ago.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:43.20" id="p93" end="00:12:45.08">With time and isolation,</p>
      <p begin="00:12:45.08" id="p94" end="00:12:50.08">its animals have adapted to take<br />advantage of every available niche.</p>
      <p begin="00:12:56.12" id="p95" end="00:13:01.40">The island now has some<br />250,000 different species,</p>
      <p begin="00:13:01.40" id="p96" end="00:13:04.32">most found nowhere else on Earth.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:16.64" id="p97" end="00:13:19.52">These are not monkeys, but lemurs.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:25.16" id="p98" end="00:13:29.56">From a single ancestor, about<br />100 different types have evolved.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:34.80" id="p99" end="00:13:38.92">The largest, the indri, seldom<br />comes down from the branches.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:46.08" id="p100" end="00:13:50.64">The much smaller ringtails wander<br />in troops across the forest floor</p>
      <p begin="00:13:50.64" id="p101" end="00:13:51.80">searching for food.</p>
      <p begin="00:13:53.52" id="p102" end="00:13:57.72">And tiny bamboo lemurs<br />eat nothing except bamboo.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:05.52" id="p103" end="00:14:09.36">With few competitors,<br />lemurs have been free to colonise</p>
      <p begin="00:14:09.36" id="p104" end="00:14:12.00">almost every environment<br />on the island.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:14.56" id="p105" end="00:14:17.04">Even the most extreme.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:24.56" id="p106" end="00:14:28.84">This baby sifaka<br />has a hard life ahead of it.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:33.48" id="p107" end="00:14:36.68">He's been born in the most arid<br />and hostile corner</p>
      <p begin="00:14:36.68" id="p108" end="00:14:39.16">of Madagascar's vast landscape.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:41.96" id="p109" end="00:14:45.20">If he is to survive here,<br />he has much to learn.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:52.64" id="p110" end="00:14:54.96">The spiny forest is like a desert.</p>
      <p begin="00:14:56.48" id="p111" end="00:15:01.24">It rarely rains, so water and food<br />is very hard to find.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:09.48" id="p112" end="00:15:12.64">Moving from tree to tree<br />is a perilous business.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:14.64" id="p113" end="00:15:18.68">Here, nearly all the plants are<br />covered with ferocious spines.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:20.84" id="p114" end="00:15:24.12">His mother searches the tree tops<br />for the youngest leaves.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:26.52" id="p115" end="00:15:30.28">They provide the only food and water<br />to sustain the family.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:36.76" id="p116" end="00:15:40.60">At three months old, the youngster<br />is starting to explore.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:46.32" id="p117" end="00:15:49.84">All too soon he will have to<br />fend for himself up here.</p>
      <p begin="00:15:55.52" id="p118" end="00:15:59.52">But it's altogether easier<br />to stay on mother's back.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:07.56" id="p119" end="00:16:10.60">If he can master the strange ways<br />of this forest...</p>
      <p begin="00:16:11.80" id="p120" end="00:16:14.72">..he will have a little corner<br />of Madagascar to himself.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:21.48" id="p121" end="00:16:24.96">Island life encourages animals<br />to do things differently.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:26.40" id="p122" end="00:16:29.40">And on some islands<br />that is essential.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:44.04" id="p123" end="00:16:46.44">There are islands<br />still forming today...</p>
      <p begin="00:16:47.80" id="p124" end="00:16:49.60">..built by volcanoes.</p>
      <p begin="00:16:53.12" id="p125" end="00:16:55.00">Some erupt explosively.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:02.04" id="p126" end="00:17:04.92">Others pour out rivers<br />of molten rock.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:06.04" id="p127" end="00:17:07.08">Lava.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:13.40" id="p128" end="00:17:14.84">In the last 50 years,</p>
      <p begin="00:17:14.84" id="p129" end="00:17:17.88">ten new volcanic islands<br />have been formed.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:45.08" id="p130" end="00:17:50.24">Newly created and often remote,<br />they're hard for colonists to reach.</p>
      <p begin="00:17:53.84" id="p131" end="00:17:57.92">Even those that do find<br />these are tough places to survive.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:03.84" id="p132" end="00:18:08.44">This is Fernandina, one of the<br />Galapagos Islands in the Pacific.</p>
      <p begin="00:18:10.80" id="p133" end="00:18:15.16">Young and still volcanically active,<br />it's a desolate place.</p>

      <p begin="00:41:43.40" id="p276" end="00:41:46.68">It's not only surrounded<br />by the stormiest of seas,</p>
      <p begin="00:41:46.68" id="p277" end="00:41:49.24">it is itself an active volcano.</p>
      <p begin="00:41:52.16" id="p278" end="00:41:55.24">It's the last place on Earth<br />you would choose to live.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:04.36" id="p279" end="00:42:07.28">Unless you're a chinstrap penguin.</p>
      <p begin="00:42:10.08" id="p280" end="00:42:13.48">There is plenty of food in these<br />waters, but to exploit it,</p>
      <p begin="00:42:13.48" id="p281" end="00:42:15.64">the penguins<br />have to risk their lives.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:04.80" id="p282" end="00:43:08.36">Life here is dangerous<br />in the extreme.</p>

      <p begin="00:43:25.64" id="p284" end="00:43:29.12">But there are some benefits<br />from living on a volcano.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:31.68" id="p285" end="00:43:35.88">Its warmth melts the snow<br />early in the year.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:35.88" id="p286" end="00:43:39.32">And, by January,<br />the Antarctic's mid-summer,</p>
      <p begin="00:43:39.32" id="p287" end="00:43:41.68">the island is covered in chicks.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:46.16" id="p288" end="00:43:48.64">Parents take turns at guarding them</p>
      <p begin="00:43:48.64" id="p289" end="00:43:51.96">until they're large enough<br />to be left alone.</p>
      <p begin="00:43:56.40" id="p290" end="00:44:01.40">This mother's chicks are hungry, but<br />she has no food left to give them.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:03.16" id="p291" end="00:44:07.24">Their survival depends on their<br />father returning with the next meal.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:11.72" id="p292" end="00:44:13.36">But some don't make it.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:27.52" id="p293" end="00:44:31.76">Skuas harass the colony,<br />hoping to snatch a chick.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:39.32" id="p294" end="00:44:41.12">She can't risk leaving them.</p>
      <p begin="00:44:46.20" id="p295" end="00:44:50.04">Everything will be fine, as long<br />as their father comes back soon.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:19.36" id="p296" end="00:45:24.36">He's been fishing 50 miles offshore,<br />but now he's not far away.</p>
      <p begin="00:45:27.36" id="p297" end="00:45:30.76">For him, however,<br />and for all the other parents here,</p>
      <p begin="00:45:30.76" id="p298" end="00:45:33.08">the worst of the journey<br />is still to come.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:05.28" id="p299" end="00:46:09.64">Tiny claws help him to get whatever<br />grip he can on the rough lava.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:37.52" id="p300" end="00:46:40.40">For these commuters, it's rush hour.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:42.04" id="p301" end="00:46:44.76">Some have had a really bad day.</p>
      <p begin="00:46:49.08" id="p302" end="00:46:53.36">The father now has<br />a two-mile walk to the nest,</p>
      <p begin="00:46:53.36" id="p303" end="00:46:55.80">and a stomach loaded<br />with food doesn't help.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:02.88" id="p304" end="00:47:06.52">This is the largest penguin colony<br />in the world.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:13.56" id="p305" end="00:47:16.92">But as he makes the same journey<br />every other day,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:16.92" id="p306" end="00:47:19.96">he should be able to do it<br />with his eyes closed.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:28.56" id="p307" end="00:47:31.72">It's true that<br />there can be safety in numbers,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:31.72" id="p308" end="00:47:34.20">but numbers<br />can also be something of a problem</p>
      <p begin="00:47:34.20" id="p309" end="00:47:36.60">when you're trying<br />to find your own nest.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:43.12" id="p310" end="00:47:45.00">The mother is still waiting.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:47.20" id="p311" end="00:47:49.08">Her chicks are now desperate.</p>
      <p begin="00:47:49.08" id="p312" end="00:47:50.88">THEY CHEEP</p>
      <p begin="00:47:55.04" id="p313" end="00:47:57.76">In the midst of all this<br />deafening chorus,</p>
      <p begin="00:47:57.76" id="p314" end="00:47:59.80">he can recognise her particular cry.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:19.64" id="p315" end="00:48:21.00">At last.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:36.12" id="p316" end="00:48:38.48">Both chicks will get a meal.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:45.36" id="p317" end="00:48:50.16">With a head bob of acknowledgement,<br />their mother now leaves.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:50.16" id="p318" end="00:48:53.36">It's her turn to do the feeding run.</p>
      <p begin="00:48:59.72" id="p319" end="00:49:06.40">This formidable commute is the price<br />these penguins pay for sanctuary.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:12.24" id="p320" end="00:49:15.76">A strange vision of paradise<br />to us, perhaps,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:15.76" id="p321" end="00:49:21.56">but, for one and a half million<br />penguins, this island has it all.</p>
      <p begin="00:49:32.16" id="p322" end="00:49:36.08">Islands may seem remote<br />and insignificant,</p>
      <p begin="00:49:36.08" id="p323" end="00:49:40.88">but they are home to some of<br />the most precious wildlife on Earth.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:03.64" id="p324" end="00:50:06.72">The expedition to film<br />on the island of Zavodovski</p>
      <p begin="00:50:06.72" id="p325" end="00:50:09.32">was the most intrepid shoot<br />of the series.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:10.32" id="p326" end="00:50:13.60">To ensure its success,<br />the team have called in</p>
      <p begin="00:50:13.60" id="p327" end="00:50:16.08">Antarctic expert Jerome Poncet,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:16.08" id="p328" end="00:50:19.24">one of the few people<br />to have set foot on the island.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:21.56" id="p329" end="00:50:25.32">This whole region of Antarctica<br />is rarely visited.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:29.32" id="p330" end="00:50:32.40">And this is<br />the planet's roughest ocean.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:41.12" id="p331" end="00:50:43.68">After seven long days and nights<br />at sea,</p>
      <p begin="00:50:43.68" id="p332" end="00:50:46.60">they get their first glimpse<br />of the final destination.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:50:46.60" id="p333" end="00:50:49.60">It's actually quite surreal<br />after a whole year,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:50:49.60" id="p334" end="00:50:51.48">trying to put<br />the expedition together.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:50:51.48" id="p335" end="00:50:53.84">And then today we wake up,<br />and there's the volcano.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:50:53.84" id="p336" end="00:50:55.32">That's Zavodovski.</p>
      <p begin="00:50:56.52" id="p337" end="00:50:59.40">The explorers<br />who discovered this place</p>
      <p begin="00:50:59.40" id="p338" end="00:51:02.60">spoke of the stench<br />of sulphurous gases,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:02.60" id="p339" end="00:51:05.32">treacherous waters,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:05.32" id="p340" end="00:51:07.92">and astonishing numbers of penguins.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:11.60" id="p341" end="00:51:13.80">It seems not much has changed.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:51:15.40" id="p342" end="00:51:17.60">Jerome's been round the whole place,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:51:17.60" id="p343" end="00:51:20.56">and there literally is<br />only one safe area to get on,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:51:20.56" id="p344" end="00:51:21.72">and he's telling us</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:51:21.72" id="p345" end="00:51:23.40">it's that rock face over there.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:26.00" id="p346" end="00:51:29.04">The team must take everything<br />they need to survive.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:51:30.40" id="p347" end="00:51:31.80">There are the penguins!</p>
      <p begin="00:51:34.00" id="p348" end="00:51:35.60">Though the boat'll stay nearby,</p>
      <p begin="00:51:35.60" id="p349" end="00:51:37.52">they will need to be<br />self-sufficient.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:38.88" id="p350" end="00:51:42.56">But that means taking a tonne<br />of equipment up this cliff.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:51:42.56" id="p351" end="00:51:45.20">Just get to that lot to help.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:51:45.20" id="p352" end="00:51:46.80">Many flippers make light work.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:49.60" id="p353" end="00:51:51.92">They work all day<br />getting the gear ashore.</p>
      <p begin="00:51:54.92" id="p354" end="00:51:58.08">But the fact there are so many<br />penguins on the island</p>
      <p begin="00:51:58.08" id="p355" end="00:51:59.68">doesn't make it easy.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:52:00.88" id="p356" end="00:52:03.60">The hardest thing for us has been<br />finding a pathway through,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:52:03.60" id="p357" end="00:52:06.92">because there's absolutely penguins<br />everywhere you look.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:13.84" id="p358" end="00:52:16.00">Finally, it's time to make camp.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:21.12" id="p359" end="00:52:24.76">They choose a sheltered place<br />that won't disturb the locals.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:26.32" id="p360" end="00:52:30.12">But since most of the penguins won't<br />have seen a human being before,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:30.12" id="p361" end="00:52:32.52">they seem keen<br />to pop over and visit.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:52:33.72" id="p362" end="00:52:36.24"><span tts:color="cyan">Hello. </span>Nosy neighbours.</p>
      <p begin="00:52:38.00" id="p363" end="00:52:39.48">The team set off</p>
      <p begin="00:52:39.48" id="p364" end="00:52:42.64">to start documenting<br />the daily lives of the penguins,</p>
      <p begin="00:52:42.64" id="p365" end="00:52:45.12">and what they find is astonishing.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:52:46.12" id="p366" end="00:52:49.68">As soon as you walk over that ridge,<br />you sort of get a tingly feeling,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:52:49.68" id="p367" end="00:52:54.00">because I've never seen<br />that many animals in one spot.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:52:54.00" id="p368" end="00:52:55.52">It's mind-blowing.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:52:57.80" id="p369" end="00:53:00.16">It's like Glastonbury Festival.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:53:00.16" id="p370" end="00:53:01.40">The whole landscape</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:53:01.40" id="p371" end="00:53:05.48">is full of little black and white<br />penguins waddling around.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:53:09.76" id="p372" end="00:53:12.80">This is penguin paradise, and<br />that's what we're trying to show.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:17.72" id="p373" end="00:53:18.96">A promising start.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:20.56" id="p374" end="00:53:23.56">But here,<br />fortunes can change quickly.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:53:27.56" id="p375" end="00:53:29.16"># Summertime... #</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:53:32.80" id="p376" end="00:53:35.04">Every season within ten minutes.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:38.80" id="p377" end="00:53:42.88">As the snow melts,<br />it creates an unforeseen problem.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:44.92" id="p378" end="00:53:46.52">We purposely chose this campsite</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:46.52" id="p379" end="00:53:49.64">because it was a place where<br />the penguins didn't seem to go.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:49.64" id="p380" end="00:53:52.88">I think we've realised why<br />the penguins don't nest here.</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:52.88" id="p381" end="00:53:55.76">It's because of the spray<br />and because of some run-off,</p>
      <p style="s1" begin="00:53:55.76" id="p382" end="00:53:58.28">so we are literally<br />in a bit of a bog.</p>
      <p begin="00:53:59.44" id="p383" end="00:54:01.40">And it's not just mud.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:03.32" id="p384" end="00:54:07.56">A couple of these guys, as they<br />wander down to do a spot of fishing,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:07.56" id="p385" end="00:54:11.96">they tend to use my tent<br />as a little poop spot.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:11.96" id="p386" end="00:54:13.76">You kind of get used to it at night,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:13.76" id="p387" end="00:54:16.96">just hearing a constant splat<br />on top of the tent.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:16.96" id="p388" end="00:54:20.16">But, as you can see,<br />all of the kit,</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:20.16" id="p389" end="00:54:23.76">I'm afraid that's getting<br />splat on as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:54:23.76" id="p390" end="00:54:27.36">And, when the wind changes,<br />it brings a noxious reminder</p>
      <p begin="00:54:27.36" id="p391" end="00:54:30.20">that they're camping<br />on an active volcano.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:32.56" id="p392" end="00:54:35.12">It's the first time<br />we've smelt sulphur,</p>

      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:38.36" id="p394" end="00:54:39.76">It's smoking away.</p>
      <p style="s2" begin="00:54:41.36" id="p395" end="00:54:44.40">I think if they start<br />running for the sea,</p>

      <p begin="00:55:04.32" id="p399" end="00:55:06.28">Only now do the team realise</p>
      <p begin="00:55:06.28" id="p400" end="00:55:09.40">just how tough<br />life can be for the penguins.</p>
      <p begin="00:55:13.08" id="p401" end="00:55:16.44">It's hard not to be moved<br />by the effort they go to</p>
      <p begin="00:55:16.44" id="p402" end="00:55:18.04">to feed their chicks.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:55:20.00" id="p403" end="00:55:22.48">These huge waves are coming in.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:55:22.48" id="p404" end="00:55:24.48">The penguins are surfing here,</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:55:24.48" id="p405" end="00:55:26.64">getting battered<br />on these big boulders.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:55:26.64" id="p406" end="00:55:29.40">Now and then you just get<br />a penguin that gets catapulted</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:55:29.40" id="p407" end="00:55:32.52">15 metres in the air -<br />it's totally ludicrous.</p>
      <p style="s3" begin="00:55:34.88" id="p408" end="00:55:38.92">And really, I think there are quite<br />a few penguins getting killed in it.</p>
